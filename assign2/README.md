At startup, the clock begins at 0000. We can then turn the knob clockwise to increase (or counterclockwise to decrease) the first digit (0 to 9). Note that when you increase past 9, it goes back to 0. And when you go past 0, it will reset to 9. When you are done, you can press down on the knob and the screen will flash. You may then start turning the knob again to change the second digit. You can do this again and again for each digit, but note tha the third 3rd digit is limited to 5 instead of 9 as it represents the tens digit for seconds. After the final digit, pressing the knob will initiate the timer. At the end, the screen will flash and a buzzer will play.
