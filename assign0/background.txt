9.I keep all my windows open on the home screen of my laptop (because macs have limited split screen capabilities). This usually means I have the directions on the top of the screen, with two terminals on the bottom.

If space runs out, I will use a second monitor (iPad) to keep my instructions, and have all the code on my laptop screen.
